# Data-Structures-and-algorithm

# Throughout this course I went deeply through a variety of different types of data structures such as heaps, maps, Arrays, Stacks, queues, Binary trees, BFS, and DFS( graphs). I am not confident and able to understand different algorithims and running time complexities.
